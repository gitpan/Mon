CHANGELOG

Differences between Mon-0.8 and 0.9:
Mon Feb 28 04:59:39 PST 2000
------------------------------------

  -removed prot_cmp functions and no more support
   for talking with 0.37 servers. prot_cmp was making
   monshow fail with "unknown protocol" error.


Differences between Mon-0.7 and 0.8:
Tue Feb 22 08:51:42 PST 2000
------------------------------------
  -fixed the operation of the "test" command

  -list_opstatus now accepts ([group, service], ...)

  -version is now set properly

  -added list_watch

  -added protid, and optionally verify protocol ID upon
   connect (can be disabled, read the man page).


Differences between Mon-0.6 and 0.7:
Sun Feb  6 13:07:57 PST 2000
------------------------------------
    -Fixed a problem with the "test" function. It now requires
     the type of test as the first argument. Bug reported by
     andrewr@myCFO.com and rjentsch@electronicpartner.de.

    -reload accepts arguments such as "reload auth"

    -fix "list pids" output parsing to match what mon-0.38.16 does.

    -list_dtlog submitted by Martha H Greenberg <marthag@mit.edu>


Differences between Mon-0.5 and 0.6:
Tue Nov 16 10:51:26 PST 1999
------------------------------------
    -Added Mon::Protocol.

    -Some code cleanups

    -Added new quoting rules for mon-0.38.15

    -implemented get and set

    -supports escaped values


Differences between Mon-0.4 and 0.5:
------------------------------------
    -Fixed bug in old (before 0.38) opstatus parsing for Client.pm


Differences between Mon-0.3 and 0.4:
------------------------------------
    -Changed argument format for "prot", and added "prot_cmp", and
     made appropriate documentation updates.

    -$self->{"VERSION"} now defaults to undef (like it should),
     since it is not the _requested_ protocol version, it is the
     version obtained by asking the server. The _requested_ protocol
     version is specified via $self->prot().

    -_list_opstatus now uses $self->prot() to figure out how to behave
     when talking to the server.

    -Export %OPSTAT for use by clients


Differences between Mon-0.1 and 0.3:
------------------------------------

    -Added send_trap, submitted by Lars Marowsky-Bree <lmb@teuto.net>.

    -new now lets you initialize variables.

    -Updated docs.
